The AI engineer's trajectory reflects a comprehensive development and refactoring process for the Styx Cafe application. It began with enhancing an existing Node.js/React stack, pivoted to a Sporty app concept, then rolled back to critically refine the Styx Cafe system. Key phases included extensive frontend UX/UI fixes, a major authentication system overhaul from Twilio-based OTP to password login, and persistent debugging of deployment issues. A significant architectural shift involved completely migrating the Node.js/Express backend to FastAPI/Python to align with the platform's FARM stack support. The recent focus has been on resolving deployment blockers, improving user navigation and experience on specific pages, and most recently, orchestrating the deployment of the admin panel to a dedicated subdomain.

The project aimed to build a full-stack Styx Cafe application, initially by replicating an existing frontend and integrating a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend. This required distinct admin and customer React frontends, featuring multi-role login (customer, admin, super admin), and a List Your Court signup for cafe owners. A proposed Sporty application was to be a modern sports facility booking platform with advanced UI/UX (motion backgrounds, glassmorphism, AI text). After issues, a full rollback to Styx Cafe was requested, focusing on responsive design, dynamic data loading for cafes/locations, Contact Us and List Your Court forms, and critical login/registration flows. Subsequent explicit requests included fixing non-functional logins, addressing network errors during registration, improving user feedback with micro popups, removing Twilio-based OTP in favor of password login, ensuring registration forms are visible without overlays, making the Styx logo navigate to home, fixing mobile/tablet login visibility, and deploying the admin panel to a subdomain.

- **Full-stack**: React (CRA/Vite), FastAPI, MongoDB.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit.
- **Deployment**: Supervisor, Nginx, Certbot (for SSL), Kubernetes.
- **API Integration**: Axios, Express (old backend), FastAPI (new backend).
- **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt (password hashing).
- **UI/UX**: , responsive design.
- **Database**: MongoDB, Pydantic (models with FastAPI).

The codebase is now structured into three primary applications under :  (renamed from ),  (renamed from ), and  (renamed from ).



**Key Files and Changes Summary:**

*   ****: The central FastAPI application file. It now handles routing, database connection, and incorporates various routers (e.g., ). This replaced the entire Node.js  as the backend entry point.
*   ****: This file now lists Python dependencies essential for the FastAPI backend, including To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , and . This ensures the Python environment is correctly set up.
*   ****: Defines API endpoints  and  for customer authentication, now implemented in FastAPI. It utilizes  models and  utilities for password hashing and JWT.
*   ****: Critically modified to remove OTP-based authentication, integrate password-based login/registration forms, display  notifications, and include a registration success modal. The form overlay issue was also resolved here.
*   ****: Updated to ensure the Styx logo links to the home page, fixed the disappearance of the login button in mobile/tablet views, and correctly passes authentication mode to  and .
*   ****: Enhanced with a navigation bar containing a back button and improved logo alignment, greatly improving user experience on this form page.
*   ** and **: Both updated to reference the newly added , and the Google Maps script in the customer frontend was removed as it wasn't used for the JS API.
*   ****: This configuration file was updated to point the backend service to run the FastAPI application using  and the new  entry point, ensuring the Python backend starts correctly.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on the comprehensive deployment of the Styx Admin Panel to . The user provided a detailed, multi-agent orchestration plan for this deployment. The current work is focused on Step 1: DevOps Agent - Deployment Configuration. This involves verifying the existence of the admin panel codebase, building the production assets for both the admin panel () and the main customer frontend (), and updating their respective  files to correctly point to the production API and admin panel URLs. Specifically, the   was set to , and  was updated with  and  pointing to . Both applications have been successfully rebuilt, and the next step in the orchestration is to configure Nginx.
