The AI engineer successfully migrated a frontend-only Styx Cafe application to a full-stack architecture by integrating a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend. This involved reorganizing the codebase into distinct ,  (customer frontend), and  directories. Key tasks included setting up environment variables, supervisor configurations for multiple services, and resolving numerous frontend rendering issues (case-sensitivity, loader component, commented JSX). The engineer also implemented membership management, a List Your Court feature, and robust authentication. A major challenge involved correctly routing and displaying the multiple frontends via a preview URL, which was resolved by swapping ports with support agent guidance. The work culminated in a fully functional Styx Cafe platform, ready for future development on a new Sporty application.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to replicate the existing  (frontend-only) repository and add new frontend features. This evolved into integrating a Node.js backend () to create a full-stack application, including membership management. The project further expanded to establish two distinct frontends: an admin panel and a customer-facing website. Key requirements included customer login, user admin login, super admin login via a dropdown, a List Your Court signup workflow for cafe owners, and ensuring all functionalities were working properly across both frontends and the backend. The current phase is to develop a new, separate Sporty application, referencing the Styx Cafe system, with specific UI/UX features like minimal hero sections, motion loop backgrounds (sports scenes), card-based grid layouts, glassmorphic booking panels, 3D floating icons (React Three Fiber), and AI text animations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack development**: React (Vite/CRA), Node.js (Express), MongoDB.
-   **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for frontend.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, SCSS for custom styles.
-   **Deployment/Orchestration**: Supervisor for managing multiple services (frontend, backend, MongoDB).
-   **Routing**: React Router for frontend, Express Router for backend.
-   **API Integration**: Axios for HTTP requests, CORS for cross-origin communication.
-   **Authentication**: OTP-based login, JWT (implied by Redux slices).
-   **Database Seeding**: Node.js script for populating MongoDB with sample data.
-   **UI/UX**: Glassmorphism, 3D graphics (React Three Fiber), motion backgrounds for the Sporty app.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The final codebase is organized into three main directories under : , , and .



-   ****: Main entry point for the Node.js backend. Configures Express, CORS, and mounts various API routers. Updated to include explicit origins for  and  preview URLs and allow credentials.
-   ****: Stores MongoDB connection string and other backend environment variables.
-   ****: New controller for handling the List Your Court (cafe owner signup) logic, including registration and pending approval status.
-   ****: Defines the API route () for cafe owner registration, linked to the  controller.
-   ****: Main authentication router. Modified to include the new cafe signup route.
-   ****: A newly created script to populate the MongoDB database with sample cafe and location data. This was crucial for testing the frontend with actual data. Updated to fix schema validation issues (location coordinates, cafe ownership type).
-   ****: Contains  and .
-   ****: Frontend build configuration. Updated to include  and  for preview access, and  to 3001.
-   ****: Stores  (points to backend),  (points to admin panel), and .
-   ****: The main header component for the customer website. Significantly modified to include a  component and integrate  for various login types (Customer, Admin, Super Admin). Initial  call that caused blocking was conditionally handled and later commented out.
-   ****: New component created to handle the multi-login dropdown in the customer website header. It contains links/buttons for Customer Login, Admin Login, Super Admin Login, and Signup.
-   ****: The offcanvas modal for user authentication. Initially, its JSX was entirely commented out, leading to a non-functional modal. This was fixed by the  by uncommenting and ensuring  was set to allow clicks through the backdrop.
-   ****: New page component for cafe owners to sign up and list their courts. Includes forms for owner and venue information.
-   ****: Defines all frontend routes. Updated to include .
-   ****: The main frontend router component. Updated to render the  page.
-   ****: Contains supervisor configuration files (, , ) to run all services in the background. Ports were swapped (customer website to 3000, admin panel to 3001) to correctly route the default preview URL to the customer-facing site.
-   ****: The main supervisor configuration. Modified to include all new service configurations and remove the old FastAPI backend reference.

-   Develop a new Sporty application with specific UI/UX features (minimal hero, motion loop backgrounds, card-based grid layouts, glassmorphic booking panels, 3D floating icons, AI text animations).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with developing a completely new application named Sporty. This application will be a sports facility/court booking platform, drawing reference from the established Styx Cafe system for core features like venues, bookings, inventory, and membership.

However, the Sporty application has distinct, modern UI/UX requirements:
-   **Minimal Hero Section**: A clean and uncluttered main banner area.
-   **Motion Loop Backgrounds**: Dynamic sports scenes that gently fade in and out, creating an immersive visual experience.
-   **Card-based Grid Layouts**: Content displayed in visually appealing, organized cards with gradient borders.
-   **Glassmorphic Booking Panels**: Transparent, frosted-glass-like booking interfaces, giving a sleek and modern feel.
-   **3D Floating Icons**: Interactive three-dimensional icons for each sport, likely implemented using libraries like React Three Fiber, to enhance visual engagement.
-   **Dark + Bright Gradient Glow Palette**: A color scheme that combines dark backgrounds with vibrant, glowing gradients.
-   **Smooth AI Text Animations**: Engaging text animations, such as Hey Player, what do you want to play today?, dynamically responding to user interaction or context.

The current work involves the initial planning and setup for this new Sporty application, based on these detailed design and functional requirements. No code has been written for the Sporty application yet; the last interaction was clarifying these requirements.
